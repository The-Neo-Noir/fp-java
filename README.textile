h1. Functional Programming... in Java?

This is the source code for exercises for a workshop on Functional Programming in Java held at the Roots 2012 Conference in Bergen, Norway by Fredrik Vraalsen. The workshop is partially based on "another workshop on Functional Programming":https://bitbucket.org/stoyle/functional-workshop held by Fredrik Vraalsen and Alf Kristian St√∏yle. Both work for "Knowit AS":http://www.knowit.no/.

The purpose is to teach Java devs what functional programming is about. It is introductory, and is meant to take about 3 hours to complete.
